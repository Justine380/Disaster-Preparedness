                      A pandemic is a disease outbreak that spans several
                      countries and affects a large number of people. Pandemics
                      are most often caused by viruses which can easily spread
                      from person to person.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      A new virus can emerge from anywhere and quickly spread
                      around the world. It is hard to predict when or where the
                      next new pandemic will emerge.
                    </p>

                        Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least
                        20 seconds and try not to touch your eyes, nose or
                        mouth.

                      <li>

                        and people who are not part of your household.
                      </li>

                      <li>
                        Clean and disinfect high-touch objects and surfaces.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Stay at home as much as possible to prevent the spread
                        of disease.
