        <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>Disaster preparedness is a critical part of community resilience. By taking steps to prepare for potential disasters, you can help protect your family and community from harm. This website provides information and resources to help you develop a disaster preparedness plan for your household or community.</p>
     </div>
     <div class = "infor">
        <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
            <p>With increasing population growth, rapid and unplanned urbanisation, climate change, environmental degradation and widespread poverty, a growing number of people and assets are exposed to disasters.</br>

                Moreover, many of these events occur in fragile and conflict-affected states, thus increasing the complexity of crises and overburdening countries experiencing violent conflict or fragile governance.</br>
                
                However, improved practice and response mechanisms save lives and strengthen the countries and communitiesâ€™ ability to reduce the impact of disasters.</br>
                
                Understanding the occurrence and frequency of natural hazards, as well as the risks, vulnerabilities and potential impact on people and assets, helps to improve preparedness.</br>
                
                Instead of providing emergency response only, international efforts should help governments and communities invest in understanding risks and building preparedness capacities for pre-emptive and early action. Disaster preparedness is cost-effective and saves aid money.</p>
